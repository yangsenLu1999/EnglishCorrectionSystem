A child's education has never been about learning information and basic skills only.
It has always included teaching the next generation how to be good members of society. Therefore, this cannot be the responsibility of parents alone.
If all difficulties were known in children's growth, people would not do what they should not do.
In order to be a good member of any society, an individual must obey the rules of their community.
An individual must share the values of that community.
Educating children to understand the need to obey rules and respect others is widely thought to be the responsibility of parents.
They will certainly be the first to help children learn what is important in life.
They will certainly be the first to help children learn how they are expected to behave.
They will certainly be the first to help children learn what role they will play in the world.
However, learning to understand and to share the value system of a society cannot be achieved only in home.
Once a child goes to school, they are entering a wider community where teachers and peers will have just as much influence for them as their parents do at home.
At school, children will experience working and living with people from a variety of backgrounds.
This experience should teach them how to cooperate with each other and how to contribute to their community.
But to be a valuable member of any community is not like learning a simple skill.
It is something that an individual goes on learning throughout life.
It is the responsibility of every member of a society for helping the younger generation to become responsible for that society.
